# 📊 Dataset

This project uses the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset, a real-world clinical dataset containing patient health attributes associated with heart failure outcomes.

The dataset includes demographic information, physiological measurements, and comorbidity indicators such as:

Age and sex

Anaemia, diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking status

Cardiac performance metrics (ejection fraction)

Kidney function markers (serum creatinine)

Blood chemistry values (serum sodium, creatinine phosphokinase)

Survival duration and mortality outcome (DEATH_EVENT)

The target variable is DEATH_EVENT, indicating whether the patient experienced mortality during the follow-up period.

This dataset was used to perform exploratory analysis, feature selection, and predictive modelling to identify the most influential clinical risk factors associated with heart failure mortality.
