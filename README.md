# Heart Failure Mortality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict patient mortality in heart failure cases using real-world clinical data. The workflow covers data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, class imbalance handling with SMOTE, and supervised classification models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC to assess predictive effectiveness and reliability.

## 📌 Dataset

The project uses the publicly available Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset, which contains clinical attributes such as age, ejection fraction, blood pressure indicators, kidney function markers, and lifestyle factors, with DEATH_EVENT as the target variable.

## 👥 Project Context

This work was completed as part of a group project, where I contributed primarily to:
Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis,
Handling class imbalance using SMOTE,
Model development and evaluation pipeline,
Performance reporting and visualization.

This repository contains my cleaned and extended implementation of the project.
